# Hey, I'm Wassim!

I like to develop innovative open source projects ranging from web development to raspberry pi and microcontrollers.

You have a feedback or an idea to discuss ? Let's talk on the [Discussions](https://github.com/wassfila/wassfila/discussions) section.

## What I've done

* [Home Automation Framework](https://github.com/HomeSmartMesh/raspi) Control light, save energy with heating automations, monitor sensors. It is using Python and Nodejs services and apps running on a raspberry pi using Zigbee and wifi devices. It is used as a DIY home automation experimentation field that has no limits. This is running in real world example and being maintained.
* [Smart Home 3D webapp](https://github.com/HomeSmartMesh/smart_home_3d_webapp) Create your own Home with Fusion360/Blender and import in Three.js then interact with 3d elements using clicks and sliders. A concept to connect 3D properties and animations with real MQTT sensors.
* [Voronoi Editor](https://github.com/WebSVG/voronoi) A parametric Voronoi generator with real time editing and SVG export hosted as a free webapp.
* [Thread SensorTag](https://www.homesmartmesh.com/docs/microcontrollers/nrf52/thread_sensortag/), [repo](https://github.com/HomeSmartMesh/sdk-hsm-sensortag) an Ultralow power sensor hardware that supports "Thread" the Mesh network protocol used by "Matter"
* [simple nRF52 Mesh](https://github.com/nRFMesh/nRF52_Mesh) A zero config mesh concept developed way before Bluetooth adopted a similar mesh protocol.
* [Graphysics](https://github.com/NetworkGraphs/graphysics) Graph with Physics, an original approach for dynamic graph layout, investigating graph concepts such as morph nodes to properties and groups.

and many other projects using ESP32, nRF52, Zigbee, UWB, 3D Printing,...

## What I contributed to
* [Super Power](https://github.com/SuperPower) Low power battery charcher Project. I was part of core Team of a Big community (thousands of members), website creation, hardware conception,...
* [Open source Research](https://thesoundofaiosr.github.io/) Machine Learning for Guitar sounds generation. Co-Manager of a big community project 140 Members working in 7 research groups lead by professional volunteer researchers, resulting in a [published Article](https://aimusiccreativity.org/2022-aimc/#:~:text=The%20Sound%20of%20AI%20Community).

## What I'm working on

* [Web Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/MicroWebStacks/discussions) about the future of Web and frameworks usage (Caching, data-binding,...)
* [Astro Big Doc](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-big-doc/) is a Theme for a novel web framework `Astrojs` improves Developper Experience getting closer to web standards and benefit users with a more efficient internet. It is mainly helps with generating components on server side with javascript.
* [Benchmark Examples](https://github.com/MicroWebStacks/astro-examples) Evaluating different design patterns and usage performance, state management, caching,...
